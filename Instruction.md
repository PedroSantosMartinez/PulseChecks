# Problem Statement 
The image page you created allows users to view static images that are plain and unappealing to the users so we are losing traffic to our site.. Enhance your project by adding CSS keyframes to animate the images.  

# Project Scope
Define the CSS keyframes functionality using CSS comments. Apply the keyframe animations to the images that animates the images. Use features like (zoom, fade, fly-in/out etc.). Ensure images are consistently sized and there are smooth transitions/animations between images.
